## Digital VLSI SOC Design and Planning ðŸ¦¾ 
### RISCâ€‘V Reference SoC using Synopsys tools and the SCL180 nm PDK ðŸš€
what is RISK-V chip ?
It is considered the fifth generation of processors built on the concept of the reduced instruction set computer (RISC).
a processor (CPU/SoC) designed based on the open-source RISC-V instruction set, making it flexible, royalty-free, and highly customizable.

  ## Difference Between Processor and Microcontroller ðŸ¤”

| Feature                | Processor (CPU)                                  | Microcontroller (MCU)                           |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**          | A processor is the central unit that performs computations and controls other parts of a computer. | A microcontroller is an integrated system with a CPU, memory, and peripherals all on a single chip. |
| **Components**          | Only CPU; requires external memory and peripherals. | CPU, memory (RAM & ROM/Flash), and peripherals integrated on a single chip. |
| **Applications**        | Used in PCs, laptops, servers, and high-performance devices. | Used in embedded systems like appliances, robotics, and IoT devices. |
| **Cost**                | Generally more expensive.                        | Generally cheaper.                              |
| **Power Consumption**   | Higher; needs more power to operate.            | Lower; designed for low-power applications.    |
| **Complexity**          | More complex; requires external components.    | Less complex; ready-to-use with peripherals.  |
| **Performance**         | Higher processing power for complex tasks.      | Lower processing power; optimized for specific tasks. |

**Summary:**  
- A **processor** focuses on computation and needs external components to function.  
- A **microcontroller** is an all-in-one chip designed for specific control tasks in embedded systems.
